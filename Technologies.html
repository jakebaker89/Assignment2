<h1>Technologies to be used in the app</h1>
    <p>A list of the technologies and frameworks to be used when creating the Hillbaggers app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQLite provides local storage options for databases on mobile apps</li>
        <li>Geolocation API has a method called getCurrentPosition() which allows an app to return the current location of the mobile device</li>
        <li>Geolocation API has a method called watchPosition() which returns the constantly updating location of the mobile device</li>
        <li>jQuery events would allow the user to navigate around the app and load user specific information on page loading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am quite familiar with SQL, through my employment. I am confident in creating a database with all of the relevant constraints and proper structure, and can query the tables in the database to return required information.</p>
    <p>I have never used Geolocation API before but having researched it in preparation for the Hillbaggers app, it seems that the two methods available are straightforward and can be quite powerful hen paired with mapping data. Further reading will be required to get this functionality to a high standard for the app.</p>
    <p>I have been studing jQuery as part of this module but I have not used it before. I will need to do more research to fully understand the requirements and how it can be used to achieve the functionality of a professional app.</p>
