<h1>Sketches of the final app</h1>

<h2>Homepage</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Home.png" alt="Homepage">
</div>

    <p>This image shows a mockup of the homepage. It is a simple design with the app logo in the centre of the screen and just two menu options on the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p>With just 3 colours used, this theme is designed to be simple but also reflect what the app is about. Natural colours like green and brown are supposed to represent the countryside.</p>
    <p>This colour theme and footer menu is used throughout the app.</p>

<h2>Hills</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Hills.png" alt="The Hills page">
</div>

    <p>This image shows the Hills page of the app, where the user would be directed when selecting the Hills option on the footer menu. The menu bar remains on the bottomm and the colour scheme matches the homepage.</p>
    <p>The logo is adapted from the original round symbol on the home page, to be a header bar along the top of the app. The logo and text font remain the same, but smaller in size.</p>
    <p>Two option buttons are displayed alongside the page title. These are the filter button and an information button. The filter option takes the user to the Hills filter page and the information icon displays a popup to the user to explain the page.</p>
    <p>The table shows a list of records from the database of hills and mountains, with basic data like name, height and whether it has been completed by the user. The checkboxes in the Completed column can be ticked or unticked.</p>

<h2>Hills filter</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Hills%20filter.png" alt="The filter options for the Hills page">
</div>

    <p>The hills filter page allows the user to narrow down their search of hills and mountains in the database, using 3 options: Height, Region and Type.</p>
    <p>The height option uses a slider that the user can drag to their max preferred height. The Region and Type options use dropdown boxes to allow the user to select specific areas or hill types.</p>
    <p>Two additional buttons are included; the confirm button which allows the user to confirm their filter selections, and the back button, which allows the user to discard the filters and go back to the Hills page.</p>


<h2>Emergency advice</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Emergency%20advice.png" alt="Emergency Advice page">
</div>

    <p>The Emergency advice page shows the user some basic advice for what to do in an emergency situation whilst hiking.</p>
    <p>This is a static page with no interactivity other than to go to a different page. It is included for informational purposes only, so that a user can have access to this information in a dangerous situation, should they need it.</p>
    <p>Once again, the colour scheme matches the rest of the app pages.</p>

<h2>Live location</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Emergency%20location.png" alt="Live Location page">
</div>

    <p>The live location page shows the user their current location as a grid reference. This was designed to be as simple as possible so that the user can easily see the required information.</p>
    <p>This location would change if a user is looking at it whilst moving. This page was included so that a user would have vital information to relay to emergency services, should they require assistance.</p>
    <p>The colour scheme matches with the rest of the app.</p>

<h2>Notification</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Notification.png" alt="An example of a notification">
</div>

    <p>This mockup shows a notification popup on a users phone when they have reached the summit of a peak. The app is not open, but it is using location services to gather information and send notifications when relevant criteria are met.</p>
    <p>The notification is not in the colours of the app, but is instead in the standard light and dark grey colours scheme of iPhone push notifications. Included is the name of the app and the app logo.</p>
