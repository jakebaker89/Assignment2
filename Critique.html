<h1>Critique of similar apps</h1>
    <p>A critique of two apps available which provide similar functions to Hillbaggers. The OS Locate app uses geo location data to provide a current location, and the Groundhoppers app allows users to record visits to football grounds.</p>

<h2>OS Locate</h2>

    <p>The OS Locate app is an app created by Ordnance Survey to be used alongside their maps. It is described on the Apple app store as being <q>a fast and highly accurate means of pinpointing your exact location</q>.</p>

<div class = "summary">
    <p>The first screenshot shows main functionality of the app; live location data and a compass that moves as the user changes direction with their phone. Included is an accuracy gauge (+/- 10m), which would be useful information for emergency services to have.</p>
    <p>There is a lot of information being displayed in this app page but it does not feel overwhelming or cluttered. The colour scheme is simple and draws attention to the relevant information. The 6 figure grid reference provides a 100m square for the users location.</p>
    <p>The second screenshot shows safety advice for hiking. Although not identical to the proposed emergency advice page in the Hillbaggers app, this is fairly similar. This would be used before a hike, and may become redundant in an emergency.</p>
    <p>The final screenshot shows the menu page, with options the user can explore. The footer menu is simple and allows the user to easily find the required pages. It is clear from the design and loayout that the safety advice is a secondary function, and the main use of the app is the location data.</p>
</div>

<h2>Groundhopper</h2>

    <p>The Groundhopper app allows users to see lists of football grounds, and mark them as visited as applicable. Similarly to the Hillbaggers app, it includes a database of information about landmarks whcih users may find useful to be collated together. The apps main use is to track those football grounds visited.</p>

<div class = "summary">
    <p>The first screenshot shows the app logo on the loading page. It is a simple design but there is no text to show the app name. The second screenshot shows the user page. A user must create an account and login to make use of the apps functionality. Each of the icons on this page link to a new page. The counter in the top left corner is a convenient way for a user to see how many logged visits to football grounds they have.</p>
    <p>The third screenshot shows a list of football clubs and their ground names. Alongside this information is a counter of the number of visits made by a user. The fourth screenshot shows this same page but with a ground ticked off and the number of vists set to 1.</p>
    <p>The fifth screenshot shows a badges page, which allows user to set targets and receive achievements for their visits to football grounds. This feature has not been included in Hillbaggers, but might be something that users would like to see added. For example, the user John Doe, may appreciate a Wainwrights badge, to signify comploeting hikes up all 214 Wainwrights.</p>
    <p>The final screenshot shows the list of grounds that a user has visited. These can be transposed onto a map by selecting the map icon oin the top right corner.</p>
    <p>This app has some useful features, but looks a bit clunky. The layout is not as intuitive as it may be and there are too many options available to select on the main page.</p>
