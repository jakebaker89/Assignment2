<h1>Personas of users of the final app</h1>

<h2>John Smith</h2>
    <p>John Smith is interested in learning about hills or mountains in a particular region. He does not necessarily want to climb or hike them but wants to know how many there are in the Peak District, for example, and may want more specific information about one or two peaks. Using the app, he could filter the database to identify all records for the Peak District.</p>
    <p>When opening the app, John Smith would navigate to the Hills section, which provides the full list of hills and mountains in the database. Using the filter button, John Smith can go to a page to narrow down his search of the database. Options to filter would include region (ie Peak District, Lake District etc), height, and type (Hill, Mountain, Monroe, Wainwright etc). John Smith could select the region filter and choose Peak District from the options provided.</p>
    <p>After applying this filter, John Smith would then be taken back to the Hills page, with the selected filter applied. Now displayed is the full list of hills and mountains in the database that are flagged as being in the region Peak District.</p>
    <p>John Smith can then scroll through the list of hills and mountains to see their names, heights, and an indicator of whether he has marked them as summited. If John Smith would like to know more about one of the peaks, he can select the hill name and the entry is expanded to show an image of the peak, the location of the peak, the region, the type, and give a link to suggested walks up the peak.</p>

<h2>John Doe</h2>
    <p>John Doe is a keen hiker and hill bagger who uses the application to track peaks that he has summited and identify those which he would like to hike up. John Doe is attempting to climb up all 214 Wainwrights in the Lake District.</p>
    <p>Every time John Doe completes a climb to the summit of a Wainwright, he logs into the app after the walk and navigates to the Hills section. After filtering the database for the Lake District region and Wainwrights type, a list of the 214 wainwrights is displayed in alphabetical order. John Doe can then scroll down the list to the hill that he has climbed, and select it as climbed in the Completed column of the record. A message box is displayed to confirm that the hill is now marked as summited for John Doe, and the Completed column for that row on the database is now checked.</p>
    <p>When John Doe next wants to plan a walk in the Lake District, he logs into the app and filters to see only the Wainwrights again. He can scroll through the list to identify any that are unchecked, to find any which he has not summited. This information can be used to help plan the walk so that he can bag unclimbed hills and get closer to reaching his target of completing all of the Wainwrights.</p>

<h2>Jane Doe</h2>
    <p>Jane Doe is new to hiking and wants to use the app to notify her of when she has reached a summit, and to provide safety advice in case of an emergency.</p>
    <p>Jane has noticed that if there is no significant marker of the highest point of a hill, such as a trig point, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the summit. This is especially difficult along ridge walks, where the height does not change significantly. Jane will use the application to identify the location of the peak summit.</p>
    <p>The database will include grid reference data for each peak, and geo location tracking in the app will allow the user to get a notification when the are in the grid reference of the summit. Jane allows push notifications from the app and does not need to actively track the route. When Jane is in the same grid reference as the summit, the app will send her a notification to congratulate her on summiting the peak.</p>
    <p>As Jane Doe is new to hiking, she likes to feel that she would know what to do in an emergency situation whilst walking. Jane can use the app to provide such information. If Jane was hiking and the weather suddenly changed and conditions became difficult to hike in, it would be fairly easy to get disorientated and lose track of where the footpath is.</p>
    <p>In such a situation, Jane could open the app and navigate to the Emergency section. This section would provide general advice for steps to take in an emergency, and clearly display Janes current location as a grid reference. This would be very useful to emergency services, should Jane require their assistance. The app is using geo location data so that users can be notified when they reach a peak, and this data can also be relayed back to them for use in an emergency.</p>
